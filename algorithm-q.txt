*BASIC ALGORITHM SCRIPTING

#1
Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit temperature 
equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.


// Tests
// Passed: convertCtoF(0) should return a number
// Passed: convertCtoF(-30) should return a value of -22
// Passed: convertCtoF(-10) should return a value of 14
// Passed: convertCtoF(0) should return a value of 32
// Passed: convertCtoF(20) should return a value of 68
// Passed: convertCtoF(30) should return a value of 86


#2
Reverse a String
Reverse the provided string and return the reversed string.

For example, "hello" should become "olleh".


// Tests
// Passed: reverseString("hello") should return a string.
// Passed: reverseString("hello") should return the string olleh.
// Passed: reverseString("Howdy") should return the string ydwoH.
// Passed: reverseString("Greetings from Earth") should return the string htraE morf sgniteerG.



#3
Factorialize a Number
Return the factorial of the provided integer.

If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!

For example: 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.


// Tests
// Passed: factorialize(5) should return a number.
// Passed: factorialize(5) should return 120.
// Passed: factorialize(10) should return 3628800.
// Passed: factorialize(20) should return 2432902008176640000.
// Passed: factorialize(0) should return 1.




#4
Find the Longest Word in a String
Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.

Your response should be a number.


// Tests
Passed: findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog") should return a number.
Passed: findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog") should return 6.
Passed: findLongestWordLength("May the force be with you") should return 5.
Passed: findLongestWordLength("Google do a barrel roll") should return 6.
Passed: findLongestWordLength("What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow") should return 8.
Passed: findLongestWordLength("What if we try a super-long word such as otorhinolaryngology") should return 19.





#5
Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].


// Tests
Passed:largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return an array.
Passed:largestOfFour([[13, 27, 18, 26], [4, 5, 1, 3], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return [27, 5, 39, 1001].
Passed:largestOfFour([[4, 9, 1, 3], [13, 35, 18, 26], [32, 35, 97, 39], [1000000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return [9, 35, 97, 1000000].
Passed:largestOfFour([[17, 23, 25, 12], [25, 7, 34, 48], [4, -10, 18, 21], [-72, -3, -17, -10]]) should return [25, 48, 21, -3].
